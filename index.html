                    While not perfect, Wikipedia traffic serves as a solid proxy for the ebb and flow of a celebrity’s
                    cultural relevance. It makes sense that household names like <a

                        Kobe Bryant</a>or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" target="_blank">Elizabeth

                    get the most traffic immediately following their death. The bigger the star (or tragedy), the more
                    they are searched.

                <p>I could rattle off a dozen other recent deaths that seemed to eclipse the rest of the news cycle. But

                    The first 48 hours only tell us part of the story. We develop special relationships and often
                    identify with celebrities. This is why Bourdain’s death had such an impact on me. Watching his show,
                    I traveled the world alongside him for countless hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And now I rewatch him more than ever. How long celebrities remain on our radar provides a different
                    perspective on the impact of their death. <strong>Here are the number of weeks after death until
                        pageviews returned to normal.</strong>

                        the pageviews fell

                    But not everybody’s pageviews return to normal. At the time of publishing, Bourdain’s traffic
                    remains steadily and significantly higher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are plenty of possible reasons for this; perhaps the person was relatively unknown before, and
                    their death increased their visibility. Or maybe there was a renewed interest in their life’s work.
